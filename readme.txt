
- I used Prosper Loan Data set

- Findings in exploratory analysis:
	1- count of Each Category : We found out that most of the loans are for Debt Consolidation followed by home Improvement and Business.
	Smaller Number of loans are for RV, Green, Boat, Cosmetic, Baby....

	2- The count of Each Borrower State : the top State in number of loans is California and North Dakota is the lowest.
	
	3-Histograms for some numeric variables.. (Distrubition of loan amount, customer payments and monthly income)
	The customers takes loans starting from 1000 and custoers tends to take loans with values with multiples of 5000, alot of loans has values 5000,10000,15000 and also 20000 and 25000 and the maximum is 35000 with lower frequency
	Customers Don't pay too much comparing to the loan amounts.. so we have a lot of delequencies
	
	4- The monthly Income tends to be a normal distribution curve after discarding too high values with average monthly income of about 5000 USD
	
	5- the average loan amount for each category?
	We noticed that on average, the Debt consolidation loan has larger amount of the other types of loans followed by Baby&Adoption Loans. On Average the student loan has the lowest amount.

	6-the Average loan amount for each state?
	On average, the loans of ND & ME & IA states, has a lower amount than the other states. And DC has the largest average of loan amount.
	
	7- the top loan Categories for some states?

	8-Employment status and Loan status
	We notice that if the borrower is employed, he has lower percentage to be defaulted or chargedoff


	9-Relationship between loan status and monthly income
	We notice that defaulted and Charged off (bad indicators) have slightly lower monthly income


	10-Monthly income vs Loan Amount and Employment status.
	A weak positive correlation state that when the monthly income increase, the loan amount increase. unemployed or unavailable employment status has lower monthly income and lower loan amount than employed people.
	The part time emloyed has lower monthly income and lower loan amount


	11-If the borrower has recommendation, will it affect the loan status ??
	Seems that if the borrower has recommendations he has more probability to be chared off or defaulted !! the opposit of what I expected


	12-the average monthly income for each occupation and the average loan amounts for each occupation?
	The doctors have the most average monthly income.. and the students are the lowest (make sense)


	13-On average, the judges request loans of large loan amount and the students request small loan amount


	14-The most common occupation (The most occupation that request loans)


	15-ratio of delequent loans for each occupation 
	Nurse, analyst and computer programmer have low delequencies ratio.. Clerical and Sales have high delequencies ratio


	16-Relationship between the Employment status, homw owning and state with the ARP
	The unemployed people have higher APR (Anual Percentage Rate) for their loans
	The people who don't own a home have higher APR (Anual Percentage Rate) for their loans
	ME and IA states have a low ARP (Anual Percentage Rate)



​
I chose only 5 for explanatory visualizations (which I found most useflul) :
	1 - Distribution of Loan Amount

	2 - Top loan category for each state

	3 - Employment Status vs. Loan Status

	4 - The ratio of delequent loans for each occupation

	5 -Relationship between the Employment status, homw owning and state with the ARP
